# University - 3D Motion Identifier
A project from my third year at university as part of a computer vision module. This assignment required the detection of an object moving with non-linear motion amongst objects traveling linearly. This had to be done using stereo imagery to determine a coordinate system in 3D space for each object. 

#### Dependencies
This project requires Python with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

#### Images
The images included with this project is a subset of the images provided by the university for this project. They are included solely to aid the understanding of the codes function.
